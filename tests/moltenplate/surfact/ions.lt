# In moltemplate each molecule type is stored in a file whose format mimics the
# format of a LAMMPS "data" file (with "Atoms" and "Masses" sections).
# Once defined, these molecules may be copied and moved to build larger systems.


# We define two molecule classes to represent Na+ and Cl- ions, respectively.
# They both contain only one atom.
